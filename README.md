This HPC tutorial is based largely upon the dada2 (v.1.8) tutorial published by
Benjamin Callahan on the dada2 GitHub page
(https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html).

The core of the data processing is identical to that in the above, with modifications
to allow it to be easily run on a remote HPC system.

Whilst it has been written for use with The University of Sheffield's
[BESSEMER](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/index.html) system,
the below should be applicable to any GNU/Linux based HPC system, with
appropriate modification (your mileage may vary).

Code which the user (that's you) must run is highlighted in a code block like this:
```
I am code - you must run me
```

Filepaths are highlighted within normal text like this:

`/home/user/a_file_path`
